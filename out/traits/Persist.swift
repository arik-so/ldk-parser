				/// 
				/// Each method can return three possible values:
				/// * If persistence (including any relevant `fsync()` calls) happens immediately, the
				/// implementation should return [`ChannelMonitorUpdateStatus::Completed`], indicating normal
				/// channel operation should continue.
				/// * If persistence happens asynchronously, implementations should first ensure the
				/// [`ChannelMonitor`] or [`ChannelMonitorUpdate`] are written durably to disk, and then return
				/// [`ChannelMonitorUpdateStatus::InProgress`] while the update continues in the background.
				/// Once the update completes, [`ChainMonitor::channel_monitor_updated`] should be called with
				/// the corresponding [`MonitorUpdateId`].
				/// 
				/// Note that unlike the direct [`chain::Watch`] interface,
				/// [`ChainMonitor::channel_monitor_updated`] must be called once for *each* update which occurs.
				/// 
				/// * If persistence fails for some reason, implementations should return
				/// [`ChannelMonitorUpdateStatus::PermanentFailure`], in which case the channel will likely be
				/// closed without broadcasting the latest state. See
				/// [`ChannelMonitorUpdateStatus::PermanentFailure`] for more details.
